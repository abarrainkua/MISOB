# MISOB Framework

This repository contains the code used to run the experiments for the paper: [**_"Revisiting (Un)Fairness in Recourse by Minimizing Worst-Case Social Burden"_**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04128) (extended version is titled _“Who Pays for Fairness? Rethinking Recourse under Social Burden”_) accepted as an **oral presentation** at the _The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence_ :tada: 

The core of this project is the implementation and evaluation of **MISOB (MInimax SOcial Burden)** framework for algorithmic recourse (run_misob.py). 
This project is **built on top of** the [CARLA (Counterfactual And Recourse Library)](https://github.com/carla-recourse/CARLA) library. 
The code has been **modified and updated** to be compatible with recent versions of key Python libraries (e.g., PyTorch, pandas, scikit-learn), and extended to support the MISOB framework and the experimental setup described in the paper.

We acknowledge the original CARLA authors and their foundational work in the field of recourse.
